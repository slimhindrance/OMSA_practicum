"""In this script, we first load the system dynamics model using PySD, and then initialize the agent-based model using NetworkX. We create nodes in the agent-based model for each type of investor and each type of asset. The investors start with a certain amount of capital, and the assets start with a market capital equal to their initial market capital in the system dynamics model.

Then, in each timestep of the simulation, we run the agent-based model and the system dynamics model. In the agent-based model, each investor makes an investment into each asset, based on their current capital and the current market capital of the asset. This investment decision is made by calling the corresponding function in the system dynamics model.

After the agent-based model has run for a timestep, we update the initial market capital of each asset in the system dynamics model to its new value, and run the system dynamics model for another timestep.

This is a simplified example, and in a real application you might want to add more complexity, such as allowing the agents to sell their assets, taking into account transaction costs, and modeling more detailed investment strategies."""
